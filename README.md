# Project Euler

The purpose of this repository is to track my solutions to the Project Euler problems. Another purpose is to practice test driven development.

The idea to create this repository came from reading this article by Bennett Garner:

[Consider Yourself a Developer? You Should Solve the Project Euler Problems](https://blog.usejournal.com/consider-yourself-a-developer-you-should-solve-the-project-euler-problems-ed8d13397c9c)

The Project Euler problems can be found here:
